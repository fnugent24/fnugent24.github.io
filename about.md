## About Me

Hello, welcome to my e-portfolio! My name is Fergus Nugent and I am a current post-graduate studying Computer Science at the University of Essex.


### Why
It seems that the general consensus among both students creating them and authors evaluating them is that they are advantageous to oneâ€™s employment prospects as well as being a handy tool more generally. One factor given is that the nature of e-portfolios allows students to communicate in a variety of different ways; such as through textual, visual, spatial, and oral means. In contrast, paper portfolios and written assignments cannot fully utilise these different types of communication methods.

### My Aims
My intentions to produce this e-portfolio are to both provide a detailed account of my skills and experiences as well as to use as a platform of reflection during my progression at university. 

### How
These reflections will be displayed in separate categories of posts, easily accessible from the home page.
