#### Unit 5 notes
#### Class diagram:
A class diagram is a diagram showing all the classes and the relationships between them.
There are several kinds of relationships between classes:
> Objects in one class may contain references to objects in another class. For example, in poker, each Deck contains references to many Cards. Or a tv remote contains references to many types of buttons. This kind of relationship is called HAS-A, as in, “a Deck has a Card”.

> A further relationship includes one class that inherits from another class. For example, a Hand inherits from a Deck. This kind of relationship is called IS-A, as in, “a Hand is a kind of a Deck”.


The following class diagram shows the relationships between Card, Deck and Hand:

#### Codio Inheritance notes

**Inheritence** is the ability to define a new class that is a modified version of an existing class.

For example, in poker, there are different concepts involved in the game including the use of a “deck” and a “hand”. A hand is similar to a deck as both are made up of a collection of cards and both require the uses of adding and removing cards. But they both have differences between them as well. Lets say we create a class for each of “hand” and “deck”. The relationship between these classes (which are similar but also different to each other) is known as inheritance.

To define a new class that inherits from an existing class, you put the name of the existing class in parentheses ( ). E.g. if we were to inherit the class “hand” from the class we have already created called “deck” we would use the following code:

    class Hand(Deck):

Here, the existing class (Deck) is known as the parent and the new class is known as the child.

Inheritance is a useful feature (and core feature) of object-oriented programming. It can promote the reusability of code since the behaviour of the parent class(es) can be customised (i.e. creating child classes) without having to essentially modify them.

On the other hand, inheritance can make programming hard to read. When a method is called, it can be unclear where to find its definition. It can also make debugging difficult because when invoking a method on an object, it may be hard to figure out which method will be invoked.


#### e-Portfolio activities
An example of a Python program which uses polymorphism is shown below.

  
    class Cat:
      def __init__(self, name, age):
          self.name = name
          self.age = age

      def info(self):
          print(f"I am a cat. My name is {self.name}. I am {self.age} years old.")

      def make_sound(self):
          print("Meow")


  class Dog:
      def __init__(self, name, age):
          self.name = name
          self.age = age

      def info(self):
          print(f"I am a dog. My name is {self.name}. I am {self.age} years old.")

      def make_sound(self):
          print("Bark")


  cat1 = Cat("Kitty", 2.5)
  dog1 = Dog("Fluffy", 4)

  for animal in (cat1, dog1):
      animal.make_sound()
      animal.info()
      animal.make_sound()
