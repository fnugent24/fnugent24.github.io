#### Reflection of Unit

#### Update for assignment 2:
#### Testing for the code:
For the use-case diagram code, I tried testing the code through the method of unittest. The test makes sure that each class (test_driver, test_passenger, test_sensor_system) is being tested separately. Here. a test class called TestClass is created, and that inherits from unittest.TestCase. In each test method, assertions are performed in order to check if the attributes in each distinct class are set correctly (e.g. for Driver class, the attributes being tested are driver.name and driver.destination, and so on for the other classes). In order to compare the expected values with the actual values, the assert statement is formatted as self.assertEqual().
At the end of the test code, the additional argument argv=['first-arg-is-ignored'] is implemented in order to remove the AttributeError that is associated with the '/root/' module attribute.

The output provided suggests that the test ran successfully, showing:
        
        Ran 3 tests in 0.011s

        OK
