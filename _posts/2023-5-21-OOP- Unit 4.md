#### Unit 4 reflection
I feel that I have got a much better idea and understanding now about object-oriented programming/design and UML based on the readings (especially from Python core book which provides a very clear approach with straightforward and relatable real-world examples).

I have done some background reading and tried to research a bit for the upcoming assessment on providing a design using UML diagrams for a driverless car. I was a bit hesitant and somewhat overwhelmed initially when reading about this assignment in the first week of the module but now much more comfortable about what to do what to expect.
