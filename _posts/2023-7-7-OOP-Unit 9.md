#### Reflection of Unit







#### E-Portfolio activities - Activity 4:
Extend the following program to test accuracy of operations using the assert statement.

            # Python String Operations
            str1 = 'Hello'
            str2 ='World!'

            # using +
            print('str1 + str2 = ', str1 + str2)
            assert str2 != 'Hello'
            assert str2 != 'World!'

            # using *
            print('str1 * 3 =', str1 * 3)


The output raises an AssertionError for the second assert statement since the variable str2 is equal to ‘World!’. 
Also, since an exception is raised by the failed assert statement, the program terminates and does not continue to execute the print statement on the next line.
