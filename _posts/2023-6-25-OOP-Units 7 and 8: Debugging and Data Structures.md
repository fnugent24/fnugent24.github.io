## Reflection of Units


Return values are a useful tool in terms of debugging/seeing where the error comes from.

A Python return statement can only return an object, not a value. It can only return one object (which can contain multiple values).


#### Data structures
I feel that there are still certain data structures which I need to go back to and make sure I’m comfortable with – we focused on data structures quite a bit in the previous module and I remember going through some of them and not being entirely comfortable with.
But I do feel comfortable with certain data structures such as dictionaries and lists. 

I am less sure about others such as tuples, sets and sequences.

It’s important to focus on these (and data structures in general) in the coming few weeks as that will be a part to include in the upcoming assignment of the driverless car.

The chapter “Python Data Structures” by Phillips has been useful in providing a clear outline of the core data structures in Python 

The article by Kuk et al. (2019) is an interesting read showing the importance of Python language in the field of cybersecurity – suggests that knowledge of Python can be a particularly useful advantage compared to other programming languages in cybersecurity as it emphasises usage of algorithm designs/data structures.

Article has also led to me being (more) interested in the field of cybersecurity – potentially an area to research regarding what opportunities there are in this sector?
