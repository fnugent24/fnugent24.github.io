#### Reflection of Units

Return values are a useful tool in terms of debugging/seeing where the error comes from.

A Python return statement can only return an object, not a value. It can only return one object (which can contain multiple values).

#### Data structures
I feel that there are still certain data structures which I need to go back to and make sure I’m comfortable with – we focused on data structures quite a bit in the previous module and I remember going through some of them and not being entirely comfortable with.
But I do feel comfortable with certain data structures such as dictionaries and lists. 

I am less sure about others such as tuples, sets and sequences.

It’s important to focus on these (and data structures in general) in the coming few weeks as that will be a part to include in the upcoming assignment of the driverless car.

The chapter “Python Data Structures” by Phillips (2018) has been useful in providing a recap of some of the core data structures in Python – including:

**Tuples** - the fact that they are immutable, can use them as keys in dictionaries, and can store data in them in order

**Dictionaries**

**Lists** – the fact that they usually only have the same type of object - i.e. strings or ints, that they store the data in some kind of order, and that they are useful for modifying data - i.e. delete, add

**Sets** - that they have a very similar syntactic structure to dictionaries (instead of using colons to separate the pairs of values, they use commas to separate them), and that they are most useful when using at least two of them in combination with each other

**Queues** – including FIFO (first-in first-out) queues which are most akin to real life queues, LIFO (last-in, first-out) queues which are known as stacks – i.e. having a stack/pile of paper and getting the top-most paper at the top, and Priority queues where the most “important” items are returned first 


#### Data Structures in Cybersecurity
The article by Kuk et al. (2019) is an interesting read showing the importance of Python language in the field of cybersecurity – suggests that knowledge of Python can be a particularly useful advantage compared to other programming languages in cybersecurity as it emphasises usage of algorithm designs/data structures.

Article has also led to me being (more) interested in the field of cybersecurity – potentially an area to research regarding what opportunities there are in this sector?
