I have learnt about the key concepts associated with object oriented programming (OOP). While this theory seems reasonably simple to me, the practical using codio exercises, such as classes and objects, is more of a difficulty for me. I think it will take some more time for me to get to grips with the new syntax involved, but more importantly, to get to grips with understanding the processes that are going on. 

I am finding the codio classes very hard at the moment â€“ started doing the classes and objects classes this week and it just seems a bit confusing to me. The previous module seemed a lot easier to head my head around and learn the processes step-by-step. There was a more logical and straightforward structure to those classes compared to the ones in this module (i.e. learn the theory and then execute what you have learnt in the final exercises). I am also using additional resources to learn about the topics involved in OOP (including Udemy and Codecademy) which has helped my understanding of this topic.
