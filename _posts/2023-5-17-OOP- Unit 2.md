#### Unit 2 reflection
I have learnt about the key concepts associated with object oriented programming (OOP). While the general theory seems reasonably simple to me, the practical implementation using codio exercises, such as classes and objects, is more of a challenge for me. I think it will take some more time for me to get to grips with the new syntax involved, but more importantly, to get to grips with understanding the processes that are going on.
