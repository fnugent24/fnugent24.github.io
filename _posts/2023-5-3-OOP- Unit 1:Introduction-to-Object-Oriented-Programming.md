Look forward to completing this module, particularly as there is a strong focus on the Python language. I am also hoping to get some experience with working on Java as that will be helpful to my development in software engineering.

While I am getting more to grips with the basics of Python, there are already a few things that I am not entirely comfortable with, and would like to improve my understanding upon. These include using For loops, classes, Lambda, and recursion. I think with loops (particularly with for loops), the issue is trying to get my head around being able to understand what the computer is able to “understand” and the step-by-step approach that the computer uses.

I did not know much about object oriented programming before this module. I had heard that it was to do with certain programming languages.

**Objects** (in OOP) have **attributes** *(i.e. characteristics of that object/constituted of data)* and **methods** *(i.e. how the object behaves)*.

As an analogy, a human has certain characteristics (such as a name, a size, a shape, height) and certain behaviours (sleeping, running, collecting, following).

The notion of **abstraction** seems quite simple and straightforward to understand – basically just stripping away all of the luxury and detail, and leaving the most relevant and essential parts left.

**Inheritance** also seems fairly easy to understand – seems to be about identifying the similarities between objects and their common traits and behaviours. I.e. a human can have common traits and behaviours to another human (such as having the same height, weight, organs to another and walking, talking, moving). These more general common attributes can be used for a more advanced concept known as **polymorphism**.

The structure of an object with a **public** and both a **private** interface is an important thing to be aware of – that there will be certain data features that will not be accessible to the public/wider world but are essentially “hidden” from view. But that does not suggest that these hidden items are irrelevant or worthless; it could in fact be the opposite but that they are just not needed to see perhaps because of aesthetic reasons or other.

I think an element that I might find tough is getting my head around the abstractive nature of creating things in code.

One thing I have learnt from the reading (Joque, 2016) is the argument surrounding the nature of a programming “language” – whether it is merely a way of providing instructions to a computer which it compiles literally and unambiguously through a strict set of rules, or whether it is more complex than that and is more alike human languages which contain ambiguities, and can be creative, metaphoric etc. It seems to me that the creation and development of object oriented languages (such as Python) have been able to demonstrate that programming languages can be creative and more akin to “real” languages (Joque, 2016).

The paper also reveals that while it is possible for us to be able to access every single piece of information about an object or a bit, this seems unnecessary in order to ‘interact with a computer meaningfully and productively’, and one of the great advantages of OOP is that it can ignore/ “hide” the unnecessary internal parts of the objects without it becoming too complex to read and perform any meaningful interaction with.


A few additional advantages of object-oriented programming according to Seth (2011):
> Offers better implementation. 

> Offers better data security. 

> Offers better code reusability. 

> Provides more flexibility. 

> Supports creation of more manageable programs.
