I feel that I have got a much better idea and understanding now about object-oriented programming/design and UML based on the readings (especially from Python core book which provides a very clear approach with straightforward and relatable real-world examples).

I have done some background reading and tried to research a bit for the upcoming assessment on providing a design using UML diagrams for a driverless car. I was a bit hesitant and somewhat overwhelmed initially when reading about this assignment in the first week of the module but now much more comfortable about what to do what to expect.

Having said that, while I feel confident about the design phase of the assignment, I am less sure about the following assignment which asks to write the program for our designs themselves, as I am still not fully confident that I have a sufficient understanding of the core aspects of Python yet. At this time I can write certain aspects of Python syntax but admittedly still not fully aware of understanding why some things do the what they do.
