## Reflection of unit


**Software definition** - a set of instructions used to operate computers and execute specific tasks (what tasks are to be performed, as well as when and how to perform them).
The most prominent and widely used piece of software is the Operating System (OS).
Developing software requires a very structured methodology and follows a series of phases, i.e., requirements gathering, development, testing and maintenance. The collection of these phases is often termed as the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).


#### Software Engineering
Software engineering is the body of knowledge concerned with building reliable software systems that satisfy the requirements of users.
The goal of researchers in software engineering is to find principles that guide the software development process and lead to efficient, reliable software products.




#### Assignment – completed draft and continuously researching the topic




#### Codio – started Flode
Already have some experience with Python so feel quite confident with completing the challenges. But still find Loops to be quite challenging to get my head around so will need more practise.




On completion of this unit you will be able to:
•	Classify software and review the selection of software as a creative tool in order to solve a problem in your workplace.
•	Apply different software development methodology to collaborate, design, develop and test software.
•	Identify correct methodology for software validation and correctness.
